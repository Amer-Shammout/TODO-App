# 📝 React Todo Manager

**React Todo Manager** — a simple yet powerful task management web app built with **React**, featuring real-time updates, local data persistence, and a clean, minimal UI.

This project demonstrates how to manage global state using **React Context**, optimize performance with **useMemo**, and handle side effects with **useEffect** — making it an ideal learning resource for modern React patterns.
